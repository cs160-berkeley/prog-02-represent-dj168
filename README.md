# PROG 02: Represent!

YouVote! is a Android smartphone and smartwatch app that is for informing voters! It informs voters on its elected representatives based on the zip code! It also provides how that particular zip code voted in the 2012 Presidential Election to inform voters on its area's political leaning! So come and try my app out!
